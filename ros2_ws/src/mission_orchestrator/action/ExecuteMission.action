# ExecuteMission.action
# Action for mission execution with progress feedback
#
# Provides real-time feedback during mission execution including
# waypoint progress, safety status, and ETA.
#
# Usage:
#   ros2 action send_goal /mission/execute mission_orchestrator/action/ExecuteMission \
#     "{mission_id: 'test_001'}"

# Goal
string mission_id                   # Mission to execute (must be verified)
---
# Result
bool success                        # True if mission completed successfully
uint8 final_state                   # Final state (COMPLETED or ABORTED)
string message                      # Completion message

uint32 waypoints_completed          # Number of waypoints reached
float64 total_flight_time_sec       # Total flight time
string[] safety_events              # Safety events during flight
---
# Feedback
builtin_interfaces/Time stamp       # Feedback timestamp

# Progress
uint32 current_waypoint             # Current target waypoint index
uint32 total_waypoints              # Total waypoints in mission
float32 progress_percent            # Overall progress (0-100)

# Position
float64 distance_to_waypoint_m      # Distance to current waypoint
float64 eta_sec                     # Estimated time to waypoint

# Safety
bool safety_ok                      # Current safety status
string[] active_violations          # Any active safety violations

# State
uint8 state                         # Current mission state
string state_name                   # Human-readable state name
