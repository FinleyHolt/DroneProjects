# BehaviorTree.CPP Overview

Based on the provided content, here's what BehaviorTree.CPP offers:

## Core Purpose
BehaviorTree.CPP is "The C++ library to build Behavior Trees. Batteries included." It emphasizes executing actions rather than managing state transitions, differentiating it from traditional state machine approaches.

## Key Design Principles

**Action-Oriented**: The library focuses on "executing actions, not transitioning between states," which contrasts with state machine paradigms.

**Composability**: Behaviors are hierarchical and reusable—you can "build complex behaviors reusing simpler ones."

**Hybrid Development Model**: Developers implement actions in C++ while assembling trees through XML-based scripting, combining compiled performance with configuration flexibility.

## Primary Applications
BehaviorTree.CPP serves robotics and automation sectors, particularly for task planning in:
- Autonomous ground vehicles
- Robotic manipulators
- Humanoid and quadruped robots
- Semi-autonomous drones
- Social robots

## Tooling & Support

**Groot2** provides visual editing capabilities with drag-and-drop tree creation, real-time monitoring, and a graphical IDE experience.

The project is open-source (available on GitHub), community-driven with a discussion forum, and offers commercial support options for enterprise users.
