# VerifyMission.srv
# Pre-flight mission verification using Vampire planning queries
#
# Uses 5000ms timeout for comprehensive verification including:
#   - Mission feasibility (waypoints reachable with battery)
#   - Regulatory compliance (altitude limits, airspace)
#   - Path safety (NFZ avoidance, geofence containment)
#
# Usage:
#   ros2 service call /mission/verify mission_orchestrator/srv/VerifyMission \
#     "{mission: {mission_id: 'test_001', waypoints: [...]}}"

# Request

bool path_safety_ok                 # Path avoids NFZs and stays in geofence
bool battery_ok                     # Sufficient battery for mission + RTL
