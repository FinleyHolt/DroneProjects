# Low-Fidelity Sensor Profile
# For debugging and rapid iteration with minimal noise
#
# Author: Finley Holt
# Date: 2025-12-27
#
# Usage:
#   This profile provides near-perfect sensor readings for debugging
#   control algorithms and verifying simulation behavior without
#   sensor noise interfering with analysis.
#
# Notes:
#   - Use this profile during initial algorithm development
#   - Switch to high_fidelity for validation before deployment
#   - Ideal for faster-than-real-time simulation
