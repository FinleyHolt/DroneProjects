# Flyby F-11 System Constraints

## Hardware Platform

**Aircraft**: Flyby Robotics F-11 Developer Quadcopter
- 3kg payload capacity
- NDAA-compliant (government/defense certified)
- Open flight controller and GPU access

**Compute**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB
- 50 TOPS (AI performance)
- 1,024 CUDA cores, 32 Tensor cores (Ampere architecture)
- 16GB unified memory (GPU/CPU shared)

**Flight Controller**: ArduPilot firmware
- MAVLink protocol (standard autopilot communication)
- Uses `.parm` files for configuration
- ArduPilot SITL available for simulation

**Primary Control Interface**: MQTT
- Publish/subscribe architecture
- Topic-based communication (e.g., `flyby/command/goto`)
- Integrates with F-11 onboard systems

**ISR Sensor Payloads** (mission-configurable, one at a time):

- **Gremsy VIO**: 640p FLIR thermal + 4K RGB + 20x optical zoom
  - Primary use: ISR surveillance, target identification, day/night operations
- **RESEPI LiDAR**: 3D point cloud mapping system
  - Primary use: Terrain mapping, volumetric survey, obstacle detection
- **NextVision Raptor**: EO-IR gimbal with 1280×720p thermal
  - Primary use: Reconnaissance, target tracking, thermal detection

**Note**: Unlike project-drone (which uses T265/D455 RealSense cameras), the F-11 uses mission-specific ISR payloads optimized for military surveillance applications.

## Software Stack

**Autonomy Framework**: ROS 2 Humble
- Inter-component communication
- Standard message types for sensor data, commands, telemetry

**Flight Control Bridge**: ArduPilot MAVLink + MQTT
- MAVROS for ROS 2 integration, MQTT for F-11 onboard systems
- Requires `ardupilot_interface` and `mqtt_interface` packages

**Simulation Environment**: Gazebo + ArduPilot SITL
- Docker containerized for reproducibility
- GPU passthrough for vision model acceleration

**Training Infrastructure**: Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Computing Cluster
- Off-board training (not on Jetson)
- Deploy frozen policies to Jetson for inference

## Learning Approach

**Paradigm**: Reinforcement Learning constrained by SUMO ontology
- Ontology provides formal knowledge representation (safety, semantics, mission structure)
- RL provides adaptability and optimization
- Integration points: state abstraction, reward shaping, action filtering

**Ontology**: SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) subset
- Full SUMO too large; curated subset for UAV domain
- Extensions for drone-specific concepts (flight phases, spatial relations, safety bounds)
- Advisor: Adam Pease (SUMO creator)

## Development Constraints

**Hardware Access**: Via MCTSSA collaboration (timeline TBD)
- Physical drone available for validation testing
- Primary development in simulation until hardware access

**Compute Budget**:
- Training: NPS cluster (no local GPU limitations)
- Inference: Jetson Orin NX (real-time constraints, 16GB memory)

**Simulation-to-Real**: Critical requirement
- Must validate in ArduPilot SITL before hardware deployment
- Domain randomization / sim-to-real transfer techniques needed

## Technical Decisions

**RL Algorithm**: TBD (likely PPO or SAC for continuous control)

**Ontology Reasoning Engine**: TBD (Pellet, HermiT, or custom - discuss with Adam Pease)

**Policy Architecture**: TBD (end-to-end neural, hierarchical, hybrid symbolic-learning)

**Training Framework**: TBD (Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, custom Gymnasium environment)

## Success Criteria

1. Formally specified canonical problems (mission scenarios)
2. Domain vocabulary grounded in SUMO ontology
3. Trained policies that respect ontological constraints
4. Validated in ArduPilot SITL simulation
5. Successful deployment on physical F-11 hardware
6. Explainable behaviors (ontology provides interpretability)
