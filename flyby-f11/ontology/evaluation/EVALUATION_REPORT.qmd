# Executive Summary

This report presents empirical benchmarking results for candidate reasoning architectures for the Flyby F-11 UAV autonomous mission system. The evaluation addresses a critical architecture decision: whether to use a "heavyweight" first-order logic theorem prover (Vampire) directly, or translate the ontology to a lighter-weight representation (OWL or Prolog).

## Key Findings

| Metric | Vampire | ELK | Reasonable | Prolog |
|--------|---------|-----|------------|--------|
| Safety Query p95 | **48.69 ms** | N/A | N/A | **0.010 ms** |
| Meets <10ms Req | \textcolor{red}{NO} | \textcolor{red}{NO} | \textcolor{red}{NO} | \textcolor{green}{YES} |
| Translation Loss | **0%** | ~60% | ~60% | ~30% |
| Expressivity | Full FOL | OWL 2 EL | OWL 2 RL | Horn Clauses |
| ARM Build Ready | Untested | Yes (JVM) | Untested | Yes |
| Statistical Confidence | 95% CI documented | N/A | N/A | 100 iterations |

**Critical Discovery:** OWL-based reasoners (ELK, Reasonable) **cannot express the safety axioms** at all due to fundamental limitations of Description Logic. The ~60% translation loss represents complete loss of all conditional safety rules.

**Performance Highlight:** Prolog achieves **0.007ms average** for safety queries compared to Vampire's **41ms average** - a **4,700x speedup** while preserving ~70% of semantic expressivity.

## Recommendation

**Primary: Prolog Runtime with Vampire Verification**

The evaluation demonstrates that:

1. **Prolog meets all latency requirements** - Sub-millisecond safety queries (0.007ms avg vs 10ms requirement)
2. **Vampire fails the <10ms safety requirement** by a factor of 4.8x (48.69ms vs 10ms target)
3. **OWL reasoners are unsuitable** - they cannot express FOL safety rules
4. **Prolog provides acceptable semantic coverage** (~70% preservation with negation-as-failure tradeoffs)

**Recommended Architecture:**

- Use **Prolog** for runtime safety reasoning (<1ms latency meets all requirements)
- Use **Vampire** for offline verification of Prolog rule correctness against FOL semantics
- Maintain **dual representations**: KIF for formal semantics, Prolog for execution

---

# Introduction

## Background

The Flyby F-11 autonomous UAV platform requires real-time reasoning for flight safety, mission planning, and regulatory compliance. The UAV Domain Ontology, developed in Phase 2, encodes critical safety axioms in SUMO/KIF format using first-order logic.

## Evaluation Objectives

1. **Determine if Vampire meets real-time requirements** - Can a theorem prover complete safety queries in <10ms?
2. **Quantify translation losses** - What safety semantics are lost when converting to OWL or Prolog?
3. **Compare performance across candidates** - Which approach offers the best latency/expressivity tradeoff?
4. **Verify ARM build feasibility** - Can all candidates build for Jetson Orin NX (aarch64)?

## Real-Time Requirements

| Query Category | Latency Requirement | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Safety-Critical | < 10 ms (p95) | Must complete within flight control loop |
| Operational | < 100 ms (p95) | Acceptable during active flight |
| Planning | < 1000 ms (p95) | Acceptable during pre-flight planning |

## Hardware Targets

- **Development Platform:** x86_64 Linux
- **Deployment Target:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB
  - 50 TOPS AI performance
  - 16GB unified memory
  - 8-core ARM CPU (aarch64)

# Methodology

## Ontology Under Test

The UAV Domain Ontology (`uav_domain.kif`) extends SUMO with drone-specific concepts:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Lines | 1,213 |
| Classes Defined | ~50 |
| Safety Axioms | 10+ |
| Properties/Relations | ~40 |
| Sections | 15 |

Key safety axioms tested:

- **Geofence violation detection** - Automatic detection when UAV exits mission boundary
- **No-fly zone violation** - Detect entry into prohibited airspace
- **Battery reserve check** - Trigger return-to-launch when battery critical
- **Collision detection** - Identify when obstacle separation is inadequate
- **Localization loss** - Initiate landing when position estimate fails

## Benchmark Query Set

A standardized query set was developed representing real flight operations:

**Safety-Critical Queries (6 total):**

1. Geofence boundary check
2. No-fly zone violation detection
3. Battery reserve return check
4. Collision imminent detection
5. Critical sensor failure detection
6. Safe state composite check

**Operational Queries (5 total):**

1. Valid waypoint sequence
2. Hover capability check
3. Terrain traversable
4. Weather constraint check
5. NDAA compliance check

**Planning Queries (4 total):**

1. Mission feasibility
2. Regulatory compliance (FAA Part 107)
3. Path safety analysis
4. Capability matching

## Benchmark Protocol

For each query and reasoner:

1. **Cold start measurement** - First query after process start
2. **100 warm iterations** - For statistical validity
3. **Metrics collected:**
   - Minimum, maximum, mean, median latency
   - p95 and p99 percentiles
   - Success rate
   - Memory usage (where measurable)

## Candidate Reasoners

| Reasoner | Logic | Language | License |

| Vampire 5.0 | Full FOL | C++ | BSD-3 |
| ELK | OWL 2 EL | Java | Apache 2.0 |
| Reasonable | OWL 2 RL | Rust | Apache 2.0 |
| SWI-Prolog | Horn Clauses | C | BSD-2 |

# Results

## Vampire (SUMO + First-Order Logic)

Vampire provides full first-order logic reasoning with no translation loss. All safety axioms can be expressed exactly as designed. Results are based on **100 iterations per query** with documented 95% confidence intervals.

### Performance Summary

| Query Category | Count | Mean (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | 95% CI | Meets Requirement |

### Observations

- **Full expressivity** - All 15 queries executed successfully with valid results
- **Statistically robust** - 100 iterations per query with documented confidence intervals
- **Consistent timing** - CV < 10% across all queries indicates excellent stability
- **Low memory footprint** - 14MB peak is well within 200MB budget
- **Safety queries 4.8x too slow** - 48.69ms p95 vs 10ms requirement

## ELK (OWL 2 EL Profile)

ELK is a polynomial-time reasoner for the OWL 2 EL profile, commonly used for large biomedical ontologies.

### Translation Losses

The OWL translation results in **catastrophic** expressivity loss for safety axioms:

| Safety Axiom | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Geofence violation | **LOST** | FOL quantification not expressible |
| No-fly zone violation | **LOST** | Conditional inference not supported |
| Battery reserve check | **LOST** | Numeric comparison not possible |
| Collision detection | **LOST** | Distance comparison not expressible |
| Localization loss | **LOST** | Negation in antecedent not supported |
| Weather constraints | **LOST** | Threshold comparison not possible |

**All 7 safety axioms are completely non-expressible in OWL 2 EL.**

### What Can Be Expressed

| Construct | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Class hierarchy (UAV, Multirotor, FlybyF11) | Preserved |
| Object properties (hasSensor, hasComputer) | Preserved |
| Data properties (batteryLevel, altitude) | Preserved |
| Named individuals (FlightPhases, Statuses) | Preserved |
| Conditional safety rules | **LOST** |
| Numeric comparisons | **LOST** |

### Performance (Classification Only)

ELK cannot run the safety benchmark queries because they cannot be expressed. For ontology classification:

**Estimated Classification Time:** ~15-20ms
**JVM Cold Start:** ~200-300ms
**Peak Memory:** ~100-150MB

## Reasonable (OWL 2 RL Profile)

Reasonable is a Rust-based OWL 2 RL reasoner claimed to be 7x faster than Allegro GraphDB for certain workloads.

### Translation Losses

OWL 2 RL has the same fundamental limitations as OWL 2 EL:

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Class hierarchies | Preserved |
| Object/data properties | Preserved |
| Instance classification | Preserved |
| **Conditional safety rules** | **LOST** |
| **Numeric comparisons** | **LOST** |
| **Quantified implications** | **LOST** |

### Expected Performance

Based on OWL 2 RL materialization characteristics:

| Query Type | Expected p95 |
|------------|--------------|
| Simple class membership | 1-3ms |
| Property chain traversal | 3-8ms |
| Complex joins | 10-50ms |

**Rust binary** - Lower cold start than JVM (~50ms)
**Memory** - Estimated ~50MB

### Verdict

Like ELK, Reasonable **cannot express the safety axioms**. It is only useful for:
- Ontology exploration and visualization
- Class hierarchy queries
- Instance classification

## SWI-Prolog

Prolog offers a middle ground - more expressive than OWL but requiring manual translation. **Actual benchmark results demonstrate exceptional performance**, meeting all latency requirements with significant margin.

### Benchmark Results Summary

Results are based on **100 iterations per query** in a containerized SWI-Prolog environment.

| Query Category | Count | Avg (ms) | Max (ms) | Requirement | Pass Rate |
|----------------|-------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Safety-Critical | 6 | **0.007** | 0.010 | <10ms | \textcolor{green}{6/6 (100%)} |
| Operational | 5 | **0.009** | 0.021 | <100ms | \textcolor{green}{5/5 (100%)} |
| Planning | 4 | **0.004** | 0.005 | <1000ms | \textcolor{green}{4/4 (100%)} |

**Overall:** All 15 queries pass requirements with **4,700x faster** safety query performance than Vampire.

### Detailed Safety Query Results

| Query | Avg (ms) | Solutions | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| geofence_violation | 0.005 | 0 | No violations in test scenario |
| nfz_violation | 0.007 | 1 | Detected 1 no-fly zone violation |
| battery_return | 0.004 | 2 | Battery threshold check |
| collision_imminent | 0.010 | 1 | Collision detection query |
| altitude_violation | 0.006 | 2 | Altitude limit violations |
| must_land | 0.009 | 1 | Emergency landing condition |

### Detailed Operational Query Results

| can_hover | 0.005 | 4 | Capability inference |
| can_vtol | 0.009 | 4 | VTOL capability inference |
| ndaa_compliant | 0.005 | 2 | Compliance check |
| valid_localization | 0.006 | 4 | Localization source check |
| safe_state | 0.021 | 2 | Composite safety state check |

### Detailed Planning Query Results

| subclass_traversal | 0.004 | 6 | Taxonomy traversal |
| find_all_uavs | 0.005 | 5 | Instance enumeration |
| valid_mission | 0.004 | 2 | Mission validation |
| deep_inheritance | 0.002 | 2 | Deep class hierarchy traversal |

### Translation Effort

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Axioms Translated | 20 |
| Time to Translate | ~90 minutes |
| Estimated Full Translation | 12-15 hours |
| Translation Difficulty | Moderate |

### Semantics Preserved

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Class hierarchy | Full | Direct mapping to subclass/2 |
| Capability rules | Full | Natural Prolog rules |
| Safety violations | Full | Negation-as-failure differs from classical |
| Numeric constraints | Full | Native arithmetic |
| Conditional rules | Full | Natural Prolog implications |

### Semantics Lost (~30% translation loss)

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Open-world assumption | High - Prolog uses closed-world |
| Classical negation | Medium - Negation-as-failure differs |
| Consistency checking | Medium - No contradiction detection |
| Unit of measure tracking | Low - Uses raw numbers |

### Performance Characteristics

**Cold Start:** ~100ms (Prolog interpreter startup)
**Peak Memory:** ~50MB (estimated)
**Timing Method:** get_time/1 wall clock + statistics/2 CPU time

# Benchmark Visualizations

The following figures summarize the benchmark results across all reasoner candidates.

## Query Latency by Category

![Vampire reasoner latency by query category with standard deviation error bars. All safety queries (red) exceed the 10ms requirement threshold (dashed line). Operational and planning queries meet their respective requirements.](visualizations/latency_by_category.png){#fig-latency-category width=100%}

@fig-latency-category shows that Vampire's safety queries cluster around 40ms mean latency, approximately 4x above the 10ms safety requirement. The consistent latency across query types suggests this is a fundamental characteristic of Vampire's proof search, not query-specific.

## Latency Distribution

![Box plot showing latency distribution for each query across categories. Safety queries (red background) consistently exceed the 10ms threshold. Whiskers indicate outlier range with minimal variation.](visualizations/latency_distribution.png){#fig-latency-dist width=100%}

@fig-latency-dist demonstrates the tight distribution of Vampire's latency measurements (CV < 10%). The box plots show that even the minimum latency values (~35ms) exceed the safety requirement by 3.5x.

## Reasoner Capability Matrix

![Capability matrix comparing all reasoner candidates across query categories. Green indicates PASS (meets latency requirement with expressivity), red indicates FAIL, orange indicates N/A (cannot express the queries). Only Prolog passes all categories.](visualizations/reasoner_matrix.png){#fig-reasoner-matrix width=100%}

@fig-reasoner-matrix provides a clear decision support view:

- **Prolog** is the only reasoner that passes all three categories
- **Vampire** fails safety but passes operational and planning
- **ELK and Reasonable** cannot express safety axioms at all (fundamental OWL limitation)

## Memory vs Latency Trade-off

![Scatter plot showing memory usage vs p95 latency by reasoner. The ideal zone (green shading) represents solutions meeting the safety requirement with acceptable memory. Prolog occupies the ideal zone; Vampire sits outside due to latency.](visualizations/memory_latency.png){#fig-memory-latency width=100%}

@fig-memory-latency illustrates that Prolog offers the best trade-off, achieving sub-millisecond latency with minimal memory footprint (~50MB). Vampire's position outside the ideal zone confirms it cannot meet real-time safety requirements despite low memory usage.

# Analysis

## Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Vampire | ELK | Reasonable | Prolog |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----|------------|--------|
| Safety Query p95 (<10ms) | 30% | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| Memory Usage (<200MB) | 15% | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.9 | 0.9 |
| Translation Preservation | 25% | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.7 |
| ARM Build Feasibility | 15% | 0.5 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 1.0 |
| Maintenance Burden | 15% | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.3 |
| **Weighted Score** | 100% | **0.65** | 0.45 | 0.50 | **0.70** |

## Critical Finding: OWL Expressivity Gap

**The OWL translation cannot express the safety axioms that are essential for autonomous flight.**

Both OWL 2 EL (ELK) and OWL 2 RL (Reasonable) lack the ability to:

1. Perform automatic inference based on spatial relationships (is UAV in geofence?)
2. Compare numeric values (is battery below threshold?)
3. Chain multiple conditions into a safety conclusion

This is a **fundamental limitation of Description Logic** (OWL's foundation) compared to first-order logic.

### Example: Battery Reserve Axiom

**KIF/FOL (fully expressible):**
```lisp
(=>
  (and
    (CurrentBatteryLevel ?UAV ?CURRENT)
    (BatteryReserveForReturn ?UAV ?RESERVE)
    (lessThan ?CURRENT ?RESERVE))
  (mustReturnToLaunch ?UAV))
```

**OWL 2 (NOT expressible):** Cannot compare two data property values.

## Prolog as Middle Ground

Prolog preserves more semantics than OWL but requires:

- Manual translation effort (~12-15 hours for full ontology)
- Negation-as-failure semantics (differs from classical logic)
- Ongoing maintenance as ontology evolves

# ARM/Jetson Deployment Considerations

## Build Status

| Reasoner | x86_64 | aarch64 | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Vampire | ✓ Built | Untested | C++ with standard deps |
| ELK | ✓ (JVM) | ✓ Expected | Eclipse Temurin provides ARM64 |
| Reasonable | ✓ Built | Untested | Rust cross-compile |
| SWI-Prolog | ✓ Built | ✓ Available | Official ARM packages |

## Expected Performance Variance

ARM performance may differ from x86 results due to:

- Different instruction sets (no AVX on ARM)
- Cache sizes and memory bandwidth
- Thermal throttling in embedded environment

**Recommendation:** Validate final choice on actual Jetson hardware before production deployment.

---

# Recommendation

## Primary Recommendation

**Prolog Runtime with Vampire Verification**

Based on the benchmark results demonstrating Prolog's exceptional performance (0.007ms avg vs Vampire's 41ms for safety queries), we recommend a dual-representation architecture:

### Tier 1: Prolog for Runtime Reasoning

- Use SWI-Prolog for all runtime safety reasoning
- Sub-millisecond latency (**4,700x faster** than Vampire)
- Passes all 15 benchmark queries with significant margin
- Native ARM support for Jetson deployment

### Tier 2: Vampire for Offline Verification

- Use Vampire to verify Prolog rule correctness against FOL semantics
- Validates that Prolog rules are sound with respect to original KIF axioms
- Runs during development/CI, not at runtime
- Catches semantic drift from negation-as-failure vs classical negation

## Rationale

1. **Prolog meets all latency requirements** - 0.007ms avg for safety queries (1,400x under the 10ms limit)
2. **Acceptable semantic preservation** - ~70% preservation with documented tradeoffs
3. **Vampire verifies correctness** - Full FOL semantics used to validate Prolog rules
4. **OWL is unsuitable** - Cannot express conditional safety rules at all
5. **Practical deployment** - SWI-Prolog has native ARM packages; Vampire ARM untested

## Impact on Downstream Phases

**Recommended approach:**

- **Phase 4 (Execution Mode):** Complete Prolog translation and integrate with ROS 2 runtime
- **Phase 5 (Verification):** Use Vampire to verify Prolog rule soundness via test case generation
- **Phase 6 (Deployment):** Package Prolog reasoner in Quadlet container for Jetson

## Semantic Tradeoff Analysis

The ~30% semantic loss from KIF to Prolog involves:

| Lost Semantics | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Open-world assumption | Acceptable for safety (closed-world is more conservative) |
| Classical negation | Document cases where NAF differs; add explicit test cases |
| Consistency checking | Run Vampire verification during CI/CD |
| Unit tracking | Use naming conventions (e.g., `altitude_m`, `speed_mps`) |

## Fallback Strategy

If Prolog translation proves problematic:

1. **Fallback 1:** Hybrid with pre-computed safety boundaries from Vampire
2. **Fallback 2:** Custom C++/Rust safety monitor generated from Prolog rules

---

# Conclusion

This evaluation tested whether reasoning architectures could meet real-time safety requirements for autonomous UAV operations. The key findings are:

1. **Prolog exceeds all latency requirements** - 0.007ms average for safety queries (4,700x faster than Vampire)
2. **Vampire provides full expressivity but fails the <10ms safety requirement** (p95: 48.69ms)
3. **OWL reasoners cannot express the safety axioms** - a fundamental limitation of Description Logic, not a performance issue
4. **A dual-representation architecture is recommended** - Prolog for runtime, Vampire for offline verification

The recommended architecture provides:

- **Sub-millisecond runtime performance** meeting all flight control loop requirements
- **Formal verification** of Prolog rules against FOL semantics via Vampire
- **Practical deployment path** with native ARM support for Jetson Orin NX
- **Documented semantic tradeoffs** with mitigation strategies

The benchmark results demonstrate that Prolog is the clear winner for runtime reasoning, while Vampire remains valuable for ensuring semantic correctness during development.
