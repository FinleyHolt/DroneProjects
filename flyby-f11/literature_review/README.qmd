# Literature Review: Ontology-Based UAV Autonomy

This folder contains literature relevant to our Flyby F-11 research on ontology-constrained autonomous navigation.

## Research Question

**What is the most effective approach for leveraging SUMO ontology to enable autonomous UAV mission execution?**

Specifically, should we use:
1. Ontology-constrained reinforcement learning (RL + ontology hybrid)
2. Pure ontology-based planning (knowledge-driven)
3. Other hybrid approaches (imitation learning, inverse RL, etc.)

## Papers Collected

### Core Ontology-RL Integration Papers

1. **[Ontology-driven RL for Student Support](01_ontology_driven_rl_student_support.md)** (2024)
   - Multi-agent RL structured by ontology
   - Shows modular approach to RL-ontology integration

2. **[Using Ontology to Guide RL in Unseen Situations](02_ontology_guided_rl_unseen_situations.md)** (2021)
   - Ontology-Guided MDP framework
   - Traffic control case study
   - Focus on generalization to novel scenarios

### UAV/Robotics Ontology Applications

3. **[Survey: Ontology-Enabled Robot Autonomy](03_survey_ontology_enabled_robot_autonomy.md)** (2024)
   - **CRITICAL**: Comprehensive survey of ontology in robotics
   - Covers SUMO, OWL vs Prolog, ROS integration
   - Discusses dependability, safety, action selection

4. **[Collision Avoidance Ontologies for UAS](04_dronetology_uas_ontology.md)**
   - **CRITICALLY RELEVANT**: Ontology-based collision avoidance for UAVs
   - Safety-critical constraint encoding and decision-making
   - Direct application to our SUMO-constrained RL approach

5. **[UAV-ON Benchmark](05_uav_on_benchmark.md)** (2024/2025)
   - Semantic navigation benchmark
   - Shows limitations of pure learning approaches (30%+ collision rate)
   - Demonstrates need for safety constraints

### Autonomous Vehicle Planning Approaches

6. **[Knowledge vs Data-Driven Methods Survey](06_knowledge_vs_data_driven_autonomous_vehicles.md)** (2025)
   - **KEY FINDING**: Hybrid approaches (knowledge + learning) recommended
   - Compares rule-based, MDP, search-based vs RL, imitation learning
   - Explicitly advocates for integrated methods

## Key Findings So Far

### Strong Support for Hybrid Approach

- **2025 autonomous vehicle survey** explicitly recommends knowledge-driven + data-driven integration
- **Ontology-guided RL papers** (2021, 2024) show successful implementations
- **UAV-ON benchmark** shows pure learning approaches have critical safety gaps (30%+ collision)

### Collision Avoidance as Canonical Problem

- **Collision avoidance** is a proven application domain for UAV ontologies
- Demonstrates clear integration of ontological constraints with autonomous decision-making
- Provides concrete vocabulary examples for our ONTOLOGY_FOUNDATION.md (spatial relations, safety constraints, maneuver types)

### Multiple Integration Strategies

Papers show different ways to combine ontology and learning:
1. **State abstraction**: Ontology provides semantic state representation
2. **Action filtering**: Ontology constrains valid action space
3. **Reward shaping**: Ontology violations contribute to reward penalties
4. **Multi-agent structure**: Ontology organizes different RL agents by capability
5. **Ontology-Guided MDP**: Formal framework for semantic constraints

### Open Questions

1. **Which integration approach is best for UAV missions?** (Likely hybrid/multiple)
2. **How to balance ontology generality vs. domain specificity?** (SUMO subset design with Adam Pease)
3. **What reasoning engine?** (OWL recommended over Prolog for robots; real-time performance critical)
4. **Where is the ontology/RL boundary?** (High-level planning vs low-level control?)
5. **How to handle sensor uncertainty in ontological reasoning?** (Probabilistic extensions to description logic?)

## Next Steps

1. **Download full PDFs** where access was blocked
2. **Search for more papers** on:
   - Ontology-based collision avoidance (specific papers/implementations)
   - Ontology-based motion planning for UAVs
   - SUMO applications in robotics
   - Behavior trees + ontology integration
   - Sim-to-real transfer with ontology constraints
   - Real-time OWL reasoning performance benchmarks
3. **Have fresh agent synthesize findings** into recommendations
4. **Discuss SUMO subset design with Adam Pease** (collision avoidance as canonical problem)
