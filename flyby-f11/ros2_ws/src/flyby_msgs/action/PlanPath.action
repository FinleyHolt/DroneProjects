# PlanPath.action
# Action for requesting path planning from the global planner
#
# Used by BT nodes to request paths for transit, RTB, and NFZ recovery

geometry_msgs/PoseStamped goal               # Goal position

geometry_msgs/Polygon[] threat_zones         # Threat zones (soft cost constraints)
float64 planning_timeout_sec                 # Maximum planning time in seconds
bool allow_partial_path                      # If true, return best partial path on timeout
string planner_id                            # Planner to use ("rrt_star", "informed_rrt_star", "prm")
